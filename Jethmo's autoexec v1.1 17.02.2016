	///**Damage-display in top left corner**
///This will show the damage you dealt to ALL players in the top left corner of your screen in (small, if you have high res, dno about low res) white letters (after you've died). Which means you don't need to go into console to check.
///Keep in mind you need to toggle this script on every time you start the game and you may not be able to toggle it while in the main menu(join a server first). When the toggle is registered you will hear a small beep(often used when setting checkpoints in kz servers etc.) or a different one (two small beeps) if it toggles off.
///When this script is enabled your console will be in developer mode which means it will display a lot more info than usual. This means it will clutter quite easily so if you're used to reading other info from console you may not want to use this script.
